# IP Tracker

IP Tracker is a simple web application that allows users to track the geolocation of an IP address. It is built with React on the frontend and uses a Node.js/Express server to handle API requests.

## Features

- Track the geolocation of an IP address
- View the IP address, city, region, country, and country code of the target
- Automatic detection of invalid or private IP addresses

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Alucard2169/IP_Tracker.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

### Backend
1. Run npm install to install all required dependencies
2. Create a .env file and add the following line: PORT=8000 (or any preferred port number)
3. Run npm start to start the server
4. Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8000 (or your preferred port number)

## Usage

To use the IP Tracker, simply enter an IP address in the input field and click on the "search" button. The geolocation data of the IP address will be displayed in the table below, including the IP address itself, the city, region, country, and country code of the target.

If the IP address is invalid or private, a message will be displayed informing the user that the IP address cannot be tracked.
